#Key Features
Patient Satisfaction Analysis: Displays satisfaction scores across different age groups, racial demographics, and departments.
Demographic Breakdown: Visualizes the distribution of patient visits by race, age group, and referral type (e.g., walk-in, referred).
Performance Metrics: Analyzes healthcare service metrics such as wait times, number of patients seen by department, and appointment types (administrative vs. non-administrative).
Interactive Filtering: Dynamic filters allow stakeholders to explore the data across multiple dimensions (e.g., patient race, age group, department).
